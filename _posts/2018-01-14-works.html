<h1> Why WordPress Sucks! [Reasons you shouldn't use wordpress] </h1>

<h2>[1] Website speed is a bigger deal than you think.</h2>
<ul><li><strong>40%</strong> of visitors will abandon a site that takes more than 3 seconds to load. </li>
<li><strong>47%</strong> of online shoppers expect a web page to load in 2 seconds or less.</li></ul>

<h2>But that's only a piece of the problem. </h2>

<p>Google is now using site speed in its algorithm to rank pages. So, if your website doesn’t load fast. Don’t expect to see it on the first page of google. </p>

<p>That’s why I use Jekyll, Jekyll is a content management system, that doesn’t use a database as a backend. Making the average Jekyll sites page speed 5x faster than a WordPress site. </p>

<h2>Why WordPress is Slower than a Turtle:</h2>
<p>When a user goes to a WordPress website, the request is sent to the web server then bounced over to WordPress. WordPress has to build a page from the selected template, put the content and other data on it and send the compilation back to the user. When you’re sitting at home with your computer plugged into router site speed is rarely a problem, but over 50% of web traffic happens over a mobile device now, and lighting fast data speeds are available everywhere. Your site should be as light weight as possible, even if you believe your users are finding you from home, the faster your website, the more engaged the user can be. 2 seconds for a page to load gives the user too much time to change their mind. </p>

<h2>Why you should use something like Jekyll: (a static site generator)</h2>
<p>When a site is built with Jekyll, and uploaded to the server, it is in its complete form. Therefore, when a user requests the page by typing in your domain name, it is sent back to the user immediately. Sound faster? </p>

<h2>[2] Security: </h2>
<p>Because there is no database with a static site, it makes it extremely hard to hack. It’s still possible but the risk is lowered tremendously.</p>
